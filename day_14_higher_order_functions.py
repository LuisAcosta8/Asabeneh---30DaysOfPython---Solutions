#Explain the difference between map, filter, and reduce.

"""
map() --> map() function returns a map object(which is an iterator) of the results after applying the given function to each item of a given iterable (list, tuple etc.)
filter() --> This new iterator can filter out certain specific elements based on the condition that you provide very efficiently. 

"""

#Explain the difference between higher order function, closure and decorator



#Define a call function before map, filter or reduce, see examples.



#Use for loop to print each country in the countries list.



#Use for to print each name in the names list.



#Use for to print each number in the numbers list.



#Use map to create a new list by changing each country to uppercase in the countries list



#Use map to create a new list by changing each number to its square in the numbers list



#Use map to change each name to uppercase in the names list



#Use filter to filter out countries containing 'land'.



#Use filter to filter out countries having exactly six characters.



#Use filter to filter out countries containing six letters and more in the country list.



#Use filter to filter out countries starting with an 'E'



#Chain two or more list iterators (eg. arr.map(callback).filter(callback).reduce(callback))



#Declare a function called get_string_lists which takes a list as a parameter and then returns a list containing only string items.



#Use reduce to sum all the numbers in the numbers list.



#Use reduce to concatenate all the countries and to produce this sentence: Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland are north European countries



#Declare a function called categorize_countries that returns a list of countries with some common pattern (you can find the countries list in this repository as countries.js(eg 'land', 'ia', 'island', 'stan')).



#Create a function returning a dictionary, where keys stand for starting letters of countries and values are the number of country names starting with that letter.



#Declare a get_first_ten_countries function - it returns a list of first ten countries from the countries.js list in the data folder.



#Declare a get_last_ten_countries function that returns the last ten countries in the countries list.



#Use the countries_data.py (https://github.com/Asabeneh/30-Days-Of-Python/blob/master/data/countries-data.py) file and follow the tasks below:



#Sort countries by name, by capital, by population



#Sort out the ten most spoken languages by location.



#Sort out the ten most populated countries.
